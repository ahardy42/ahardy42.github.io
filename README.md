# My Portfolio

This is a link to my work, and my brand statement. I used HTML, CSS and JS to create this portfolio.  The theme is meant to mirror my love of the outdoors, and highlites projects that I am particularly happy with.  Currently all are homework assignments from my DU Coding BootCamp, but some unrelated, fun projects I am passionate about are in the pipeline! 

Enjoy!
