                    <p>My name is Andy Hardy. I currently live in Frisco Colorado with my wife, Katie. We moved here from the
                        Boston area in 2014, leaving our old jobs, and lack of snow, happily behind us. Above all, I like to
                        spend time outside. I ski in the winter, I bike and run in the summer, and almost always I am thinking
                        about when I am going to do one of those activities next. This is what brought me to Colorado!</p>
                    <p>For the last 15 years I have been a chemist in some capacity. I left a job at a major pharmaceutical
                        company when I left Boston, and immediately starting selling ski boots. After the first season I painted
                        lift towers for a summer, but didn't really dig the stresses of seasonal work, so I found a job
                        formulating adhesives in Breckenridge. I really enjoy learning new things, and this new job satisfied
                        that requirement for a few years. Though I have a good job, I am curious about possibilities for more
                        flexibility, yet a stable income. This brings me to coding.</p>
                    <p id="bottom">I have gotten my feet wet with a few online classes. I took a React.js class last summer, built a spotify
                        playlist generator, and I enjoyed it. What brings me to the boot camp is a desire to get deeper into
                        full stack development, and to understand what is required in a devlopment job. I think I made the right
                        choice!</p>
